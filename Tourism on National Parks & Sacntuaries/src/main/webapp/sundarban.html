						<p>A national park, a tiger reserve and a biosphere reserve in India the Sundarbans National Park is the choice of every tiger lover coming to India for catching the mightiest glimpses of this majestic creature along the Ganges delta of India and Bangladesh. The delta is closely being crusted with Mangrove forests to refurbish withthe most ardent Sunderban area along the Gangetic plains that justifies the name; to mean it as "the beautiful forest"and is being recognized as one of the largest reserves for the Bengal Tigers with the presence of the Sunderi tree species. A UNESCO World Heritage site, the Sundarbans area covers 4624 sq km in India alone to incorporate a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. The present Sundarbans National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On May 4, 1984 it was declared a National Park.</p>

						<p>Locating between 30° 24' - 30° 28' N latitude and between 77° 40' - 77° 44' E longitude in West Bengal, the average altitude of 7.5 m of the park constitutes 54 small islands and is crisscrossed by several tributaries of the Ganges. Bringing more interest in this region, the Sundarbans National Park is also composed of the largest estuarine mangrove forest in the world.</p>

						<p>The average temperature of the Sundarbans area can be marked as 20 °C- 48 °C drenched with heavy rainfalls with humidity as high as 80% as it is close to the Bay of Bengal.  Monsoons can be experienced here during the months of mid-June to mid-September. </p>

					<p>Sundarbans, lying precisely on the world's largest delta and mangrove swamp is formed by the merging of three rivers- the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and Meghnais world's largest estuarine sanctuary. The land that acted as a shelter for the refugees in 13th century is today declared as a World Heritage Center and is the most renowned place for tiger conservation under the Tiger Project.</p>
					<p>Earlier being familiarized with the name- Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in the year 1973, it was the part of the then 24 Parganas division. The area congested with dense mangroves and swampy islands, being fitted for the tiger inhabitants and so the introduction of tiger project took place in the year 2004 as a scientific research project. </p>
					<p>To continue the project in a more progressive way, the Save the Tiger Fund and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service generously donated funds to support the initial phase of researchand to collect data on tiger ecology. And today this tiger conservation effort in the Sunderban area is really rocking the dense masses with the exemplified glaring of royal tigers in Bengal.  It is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The forest is called 'Sunderban'due to the rich growth of Sundari trees.</p>
