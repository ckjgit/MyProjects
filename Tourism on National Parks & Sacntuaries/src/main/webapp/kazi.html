		<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=red size=6>|</font>&nbsp;History of Kaziranga National Park</h2>
			<p>The history of Kaziranga takes us back to the year 1904 when the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon along with his wife, Mary Curzon went on an excursion to this region. To their surprise they found no signs of the rhinos. Mary Curzon persuaded her husband to take measures to protect the one-horned rhinoceros whose population was decreasing at an alarming rate. Resultant, in 1905 an area of 232 sq km of Kaziranga was declared a Proposed Reserve Forest. Later in 1908, with an addition of 152 sq km more, Kaziranga was declared a reserve forest.</p>
            <p>In 1916, it was redesignated as Kaziranga Game Sanctuary and in 1950, it was renamed as Kaziranga Wildlife Sanctuary. It was not until 1968, Kaziranga was designated as a national park when the area was expanded to 430 sq km. Kaziranga National Park was recognized by UNESCO as the World Heritage Site in the year 1985.</p>
        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=red size=6>|</font>&nbsp;Flora in Kaziranga National Park</h2>
			<p>The flora of Kaziranga National Park is categorized into three types - alluvial inundated grasslands; tropical wet evergreen forests; and tropical semi-evergreen forests. The national park is primarily popular for its dense and tall elephant grasses intermixed by small swamplands which are left behind by the receding floodwaters of the river Brahmaputra.</p>
            <p>In addition to grasses and forests, Kaziranga Park includes abundant cover of water lilies, water hyacinth and lotus brining a beautiful scenario to the surroundings. Rattan Cane, which is a type of climbing palm, also adds to the beauty of Kaziranga wildlife sanctuary.</p>
        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=red size=6>|</font>&nbsp;Fauna in Kaziranga National Park</h2>
            <p>The land of Kaziranga boasts the largest population of greater one-horned rhinos and wild water buffaloes. Apart from them, the national park is home to Royal Bengal Tigers, swap deer, Asian elephants which along with one-horned rhinos and wild water buffaloes form the Big Five. Kaziranga is also inhabited by 30+ mammalian species out of which 15 species of animals come under the threatened category.  The national park is also rich in the population of avifauna.</p>
